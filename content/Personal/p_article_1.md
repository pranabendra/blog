Summary: My first step into the world of blogging


I had been thinking about creating my own blog for quite some time now, where I can share my thoughts and experiences. As exams are over, finally I decided to do it.

Over the course of time, I plan to write about Software Development, Electrical Engineering, Embedded Systems and Photography in general.

I start this journey, with the hope that - anyone who stumbles upon my blog (and its posts), may find something useful and be benefitted from it.
